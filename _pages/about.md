Hi! I'm Mikołaj, a software engineer intern, student at Warsaw University of Technology, and a passionate musician. My work revolve around Java, DevOps, Kubernetes, Kafka, Spring, and React. I'm pursuing my studies at Warsaw University of Technology, focusing on machine learning, specifically within the context of my thesis on "Conditioning of Musical Generative Models."

Music is a significant part of my life. I play the guitar and drums, with a preference for rock, metal, and movie soundtracks. Beyond technology and music, I'm committed to personal growth, self-improvement, and roller skating.

My website, [research.mszawerd.dev](https://research.mszawerd.dev/), is where I share notes from my thesis, insights from software architecture/engineering books, and personal reflections on music and self-improvement.

Thanks for stopping by!
